Solution to Vortex0-1
/**This program connects to vortex.labs.overthewire.org at port 5842 in order
 * to read in four unsigned ints, add them together, and send them back. This
 * in turn allows for the client to receive the vortex credentials for ssh
 * login. Original prompt is found here 
 * http://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/vortex0.html. This is adapted heavily
 * from Beej's network programming guide.
